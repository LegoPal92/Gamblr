# Gamblr
Gamblr is a Server-side Minecraft plugin for Gambling. 

Starting off, the instance creates two files, and connects to the Vault API. It injects a custom entity, a dealer, who is unharmable.
The Dealer holds a menu inventory, which has buttons, user configurable. The dealers.yml file created on startup is where the configuration is done after the creation is done.
The messages.yml contains two configurable messages, for the winning message and the losing message.
